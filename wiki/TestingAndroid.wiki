#summary Overview of Android Testing

= Intro =
We have three planes/dimensions for the Android testing:
 * *[SimpleTests]*
 * *[Benchmarks]*
 * *[StressTest]*

"[SimpleTests]" consists of two parts:
 * Tests designed by Google and shipped with their Android's source code
 * Google Android CTS
 * Manual testing - group of test cases which is not automated

"[Benchmarks]" are designed to measure 2D, 3D, CPU, Java and JavaScript and overall system performance covering miscellaneous areas (browser, network, data processing).

"[StressTest]" is simple monkey test.
