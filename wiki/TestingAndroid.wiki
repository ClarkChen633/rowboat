We have two types of tests for Android - *Simple tests* and *Benchmarks*.
"Simple Tests" consists of two parts:
 * Tests designed by Google and shipped with their Android's source code
 * Our own test cases (not automated yet)
"Benchmarks" are designed to measure 2D/3D, multimedia and overall system performance covering miscellaneous areas (browser, network, data processing).
