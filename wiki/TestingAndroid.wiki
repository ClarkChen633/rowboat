#summary Overview of Android Testing

= Intro =
We have three planes/dimensions for the Android testing:
 * *[SimpleTests]*
 * *[Benchmarks]*

"[SimpleTests]" consists of two parts:
 * Tests designed by Google and shipped with their Android's source code
 * Our own test cases (not automated yet)
"[Benchmarks]" are designed to measure 2D/3D, multimedia and overall system performance covering miscellaneous areas (browser, network, data processing).
