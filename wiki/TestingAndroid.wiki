We have four planes/dimensions for the Android testing:
 * *[UnitTests]*
 * *[Benchmarks]*
 * *[StressTest]*

"[SimpleTests]" consists of two parts:
 * Tests designed by Google and shipped with their Android's source code
 * Our own test cases (not automated yet)
 * Google Android CTS

"[Benchmarks]" are designed to measure 2D, 3D, CPU, Java and JavaScript and overall system performance covering miscellaneous areas (browser, network, data processing).

"[StressTest]" is simple monkey test.
