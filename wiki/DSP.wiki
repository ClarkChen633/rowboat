#summary This page contains all information regarding OMAP3530 or DM3730 DSP stack integration in Android
<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />
= Introduction =

The OMAP3530 or DM3730 (as well the !DaVinci (DM) family of processors) has a C46x+ DSP core embedded in the SoC. This DSP core can be used for various purposes, including multimedia decoding/encoding.

[http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/ Rowboat] DSP support is based on the TI Linux Digital Video Software Development Kit ([http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/dvsdk/ DVSDK]) for the OMAP3530/DM3730.

= Software Stack Components =

The following components form a complete software stack needed to work efficiently with DSP. They are provided in TI DVSDK or individual packages.

TBD: _Briefly describe what each component does and provide reference to all useful information_ 

 # *bios* (and tools)
 # *codec engine* (and tools)
 # *dsplink*
 # *dmai*
 # *opencore dmai codecs*
 # *additional DSP codecs* (optional), for example, mp3 DSP codec

= List of modifications made on top of DSP stack =
 # Added SYS V IPC into bionic
 # Some 'libpthread' calls are not yet implemented in android (this moment they are commented out):
   * pthread_sigmask
   * pthread_mutexattr_settype
   * pthread_setcanceltype
   * pthread_attr_setinheritsched
 # Modified build files (Makefiles and config.bld) to adapt for Android toolchains
 # Memory holes kernel patches (TBD)

= Building and Testing DSP stack =

== Preparation ==

 # Check if you have _git_, _java5-jdk_, and _expect_ utilities installed on your build host (TBD _explain why it is needed_)
 # Download rowboat Android (Eclair version) with integrated TI DSP stack from gitorious.org/rowboat:
    {{{ 
# mkdir ~/rowboat-android
# cd ~/rowboat-android
# repo init -u git://gitorious.org/rowboat/manifest.git -m rowboat-eclair-dsp.xml
# repo sync
    }}}
 # Download [http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ce/2_25_05_16/exports/codec_engine_2_25_05_16.tar.gz codec_engine_2_25_05_16.tar.gz] and place it under the _external/ti-dsp_ folder.
    {{{
# wget http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ce/2_25_05_16/exports/codec_engine_2_25_05_16.tar.gz
    }}}
 # (*Optional*) DVSDK packages will be downloaded automatically during the build process, unless you want to use local files (previously downloaded instead in order to save time on downloads. You can put the following pre-downloaded packages under the _external/ti-dsp_ folder.
      * [http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/dvsdk/DVSDK_3_00/latest/exports/dvsdk_3_01_00_10_Setup.bin dvsdk_setuplinux_3_01_00_10.bin]

      * [http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ce/2_25_05_16/exports/codec_engine_2_25_05_16.tar.gz codec_engine_2_25_05_16.tar.gz]

== MP3 DSP codec (Optional) ==

By default Codec Server doesn't support DSP MP3 decoding, you need to install additional codec (c64xplus_mp3dec_1_31_001_production.bin) to enable it. All the instructions are available on the TI wiki page [http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/How_do_I_Integrate_new_codecs_into_DVSDK How do I integrate new codecs into DVSDK]. <br/> *Note:* It requires registration to download the package.

== Build ==

Add android toolchain in $PATH:
    {{{
# export PATH=${HOME}/rowboat-android/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin:$PATH
    }}}
To build Android with TI DSP stack use following command:
   {{{
# make TARGET_PRODUCT=[omap3evm | beagleboard | igepv2] dvsdk
   }}}

It builds Android and Linux kernel for the selected platform, TI kernel modules for DSP communication and codec server. 

After build is finished successfully TI DSP specific kernel modules and codec server are located under the _/system/ti-dsp_ folder in the rootfs.

Prepare rootfs, assuming TARGET_PRODUCT=omap3evm in the command above:
    {{{
# cd out/target/product/omap3evm
# mkdir android_rootfs
# cp -r root/* android_rootfs
# cp -r system android_rootfs
    }}}

Follow the instructions in [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/wiki/ConfigureAndBuild#Install_the_Android_Graphics_SGX_SDK_on_Host_Machine ConfigureAndBuild#Install_the_Android_Graphics_SGX_SDK_on_Host_Machine] to integrate SGX SDK libraries and drivers into the rootfs. This step is necessary to get 2D GUI accelerated.

For boards using OMAP3530, use {{{ OMAPES=3.x }}} install option, for boards using DM3730, use {{{ OMAPES=5.x }}} install option.

Create the rootfs image:
    {{{
# cd out/target/product/omap3evm
# sudo ../../../../build/tools/mktarball.sh ../../../host/linux-x86/bin/fs_get_stats android_rootfs . rootfs rootfs.tar.bz2
    }}}

Follow the instructions in [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/wiki/ConfigureAndBuild#Prepare_SD_card ConfigureAndBuild#Prepare_SD_card] to populate the rootfs to a SD card.

== Boot ==

Refer to the instructions in [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/wiki/ConfigureAndBuild#Configure_target_board ConfigureAndBuild#Configure_target_board] to setup the u-boot env on the target board.

DVSDK DSP stack by default uses physical memory window within 89-128MB. In order not to change DSP stack mappings we recommend to use following memory settings:
  * For boards with > 128MB of memory (say Beagle C3, or OMAP3EVM Gen. II), use "memory hole" parameters, for example adding: {{{ mem=88M@0x80000000 mem=128M@0x88000000 }}} to the bootargs tells kernel to take first 88M of phys memory and 128M with 128M offset, so the DSP memory window will not be managed by the kernel.(Don't forget to adjust these parameters for your board)

  * For boards with 128MB of memory, add {{{ mem=88M }}} to your bootargs (rest will be used for DSP). With 128MB board you'll probably have buffer allocating problem with the omap_vout driver. To avoid this, try following bootargs additions for the display driver: {{{ omap_vout.vid1_static_vrfb_alloc=y omap_vout.video1_numbuffers=3 omap_vout.video1_bufsize=829440 omap_vout.video2_numbuffers=0 }}}. Anyway we recommend to use new 256M boards.


== Test ==

To test media playback use 'Music player' or 'Gallery' UI applications in rowboat. Supported formats are available on 'OMX DSP-accelerated audio/video codecs' wiki page.
Check for 'omx-dsp' tag in logcat to see that accelerated codecs are enabled.

= Known Issues =
 * system hangs when playback video clips using both DSP AAC + DSP Video codecs together;
 * dragging the playback progress bar causes a/v out of sync;
 * frame drops when playback D1 resolution mpeg4 video clips (_unconfirmed_);

Using ARM AAC codec can workaround the 'system hangs' issue. Revert back commit 2bec6d48... - 'Add OMX DSP aac codec support' in {{{ external/opencore }}} to use ARM AAC codec. The files touched under {{{ external/opencore }}} are,
 `build_config/opencore_dynamic/pv_config.h` <br/>
 `codecs_v2/omx/omx_common/src/pv_omxcore.cpp` <br/>
 `codecs_v2/omx/omx_common/src/pv_omxregistry.cpp` <br/>
 `nodes/pvaacffparsernode/include/pvmf_aacffparser_defs.h`


= misc notes (draft) =

One more update:

During downloading DVSDK svn may ask you something like "do you want to save this settings"(it happens after kernel build).
You should confirm it (save permanently) so it will work quietly later.

_Some updates:_
 * Now kernel will be reconfigured with the default config only if there is no kernel/.config file so: 
  # If you didn't build kernel before it will be configured with the default config and built.
  # It will rebuild kernel using your config if .config is in place (will take a few seconds if you didn't changed it).
 * DVSDK cleaning is now calling only after downloading/installing it to clean up prebuilt stuff.
