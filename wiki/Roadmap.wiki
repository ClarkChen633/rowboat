#summary This page contains the Rowboat Roadmap

= What's available today =
  * Donut or Eclair based Android for OMAP35x
  * Eclair uses NEON from skia to accelerate 2D graphics and will soon use the SGX to accelerate 3D graphics
  * Validated on [OMAP3EVM] and BeagleBoard, including !PacketVideo ARM codecs, Web browsing, touchscreen (for OMAP3EVM), and more. See [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/wiki/TestingAndroid this] wiki topic for other tests.
  * Synchronized with *DVSDK_3_00 3_00_02_44 *
  * [DSP] support (DSPLink, Codec Engine, DMAI, TIGStreamer) for Donut and Eclair

= Donut =

Open items on donut (see above for status):
 * OpenCore/OpenMax DMAI bindings
 * Miscellaneous optimizations based on ARM Neon technology (bionic, skia, pixelflinger, etc...) 
 * Integration of OMAP35xx Display features, Video Input and Camera interfaces

= Ã‰clair =

 * SGX accelerated 3D graphics *coming soon*
 * Add 2.6.32 kernel support

= Froyo =

Plans for *Froyo* have not yet been finalized, but we will continue to work on the following: 
 * Keep everything synchronized with Google Android
 * Integrate latest updates and bugfixes
 * Expand supported platforms list
 * Try to achieve record performance and stability
