#summary This page contains the Rowboat Roadmap

= What's available today =
  * Donut-based Android (currently synchronized with 1.6-rc1) for the ARM Cortex-A8 on OMAP35xx platforms 
  * Validated on [OMAP3EVM] and BeagleBoard, including !PacketVideo ARM codecs, Web browsing, touchscreen (for OMAP3EVM), and more. See [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/wiki/TestingAndroid this] wiki topic for other tests.
  * Synchronized with *DVSDK_3_00 3_00_02_44 *
  * [DSP] support (DSPLink, DMAI, TIGStreamer)

= Donut =

The following work is planned for *Donut*:
 * OpenCore/OpenMax DMAI bindings
 * Miscellaneous optimizations based on ARM Neon technology (bionic, skia, pixelflinger, etc...) 
 * Integration of OMAP35xx Display features, Video Input and Camera interfaces

= Éclair (coming soon) =

Following work is planned for *Éclair*:
 * Move forward all Donut work (boards support, DSP, misc optimizations) to Éclair
 * Support of hardware-accelerated 3D graphics
 * 2D acceleration based on Neon and DSP
 * Revised Neon support (fully integrated for best performance)
 * Support of new hardware platforms/boards

= Flan =

Plans for *Flan* have not yet been finalized, but we will continue to work on the following: 
 * Keep everything synchronized with Google Android
 * Integrate latest updates and bugfixes
 * Expand supported platforms list
 * Try to achieve record performance and stability
