#summary This page contains the Rowboat Roadmap

= What's available today =
  * Donut-based Android (currently synchronized with 1.6-rc1) for the ARM Cortex-A8 on OMAP35xx platforms 
  * Validated on OMAP3EVM and BeagleBoard, including !PacketVideo ARM codecs, Web browsing, touchscreen (for OMAP3EVM), and more. See [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/wiki/TestingAndroid this] wiki topic for other tests.

Work is being planned for *Éclair*, but the most important features are:
 * Support of hardware-accelerated 3D graphics
 * 2D acceleration based on Neon and DSP
 * Revised Neon support (fully integrated for best performance)
 * Support of new hardware platforms/boards

= Flan =

Plans for *Flan* have not yet been finalized, but we will continue to work on the following: 
 * Keep everything synchronized with Google Android
 * Integrate latest updates and bugfixes
