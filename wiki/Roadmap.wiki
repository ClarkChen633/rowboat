#summary This page contains the Rowboat Roadmap

= What's available today =
  * Donut-based Android (currently synchronized with 1.6-rc1) for ARM-only of OMAP35xx 
  * Validated on OMAP3EVM and BeagleBoard, including !PacketVideo ARM codecs, Web browsing, touchscreen (for OMAP3EVM), and more. See [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/wiki/TestingAndroid this] wiki topic for other tests.

= Donut =

The following work is planned for *Donut*:
 * Integration of DSP support (DSPLink, DMAI) and Multimedia on top of it via GStreamer and OpenCore/OpenMax
 * Miscellaneous optimizations based on ARM Neon technology (bionic, skia, pixelflinger, etc...) 
 * Integration of OMAP35xx Display features and Camera interface

= Éclair =

Work is being planned for *Éclair*, but the most important features are:
 * Support of hardware-accelerated 3D graphics
 * 2D acceleration based on Neon and DSP
 * Revised Neon support (fully integrated everywhere where it gives performance benefits)
 * Support of new hardware platforms/boards

= Flan =

Plans for *Flan* has not yet been finalized, we will continue the work in following directions: 
 * keep everything synchronized with Google Android
 * integrate latest updates and bugfixes
 * expand supported platforms list
 * try to be better to achieve record performance and stability bar
