#summary Benchmarks - currently a work in progress

= Goal =

The goal is to create a set of performance test applications for the Android Platform.

= Try it now =

You can get Benchmarking application from the [http://rowboat.googlecode.com/files/GeneralRunner.apk Downloads section]

Here's example if you want to add this on your sdcard:
{{{
mount sdcard
put GeneralRunner.apk to <sdcard>/data/app
sync
unmount
}}}
Running on the device: Open Applications menu, Run *!GeneralRunner* 

Alternatively you can use ADB


= Hardware =
   * OMAP3EVM and BeagleBoard 
   * Android ARM Emulator 
   * HTC myTouch (ARM11), HTC Dream G1

=== 2D ===
 * First at all is fillrate test (full screen filling). 
 * Same as first but draw filled rectangles 
 * Draw some bitmaps at some time 
 * Draw some primitives, like dots, lines and arcs 

For performing 2D speed test we have almost all things in API samples. So with small changes we use it in our test.

==== Problems ====
So in performing this set, found some troubles:
 * Android has 2 methods for graphics output, first - synchronous, initiated by VM, second - with maximum performance available.
 * All test made by first method, and FPS and other counting values has no mean. Second can not be tested on emulator, because in case running on it we have full CPU load and nothing changes with more or less hard tests.

Second method must be checked on real HW, for make some decisions.

Good links for understand this is:

 * [http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/index.html Graphics 2D]
 * [http://developer.android.com/guide/samples/LunarLander/src/com/example/android/lunarlander/LunarLander.html LunarLander]

=== 3D ===
 * Render box 
 * Render textured box 
 * Render some scene, like teapot or something like that, and count FPS and polycounts 
 * Same, but textured 
 * Not sure but we can test shaders speed if they presents in API (1.5-1.6) 
 * GLXGears partially we have almost all things for this benchmarking, we need more complex resource consumption scene, but I believe that we can find some. 

== CPU High Load ==
We use 4 mathematical methods witch heavy arithmetical calculations:
   * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set Mandelbrot set] 
   * Jacobi 
   * Spectral Normalization  
   * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone Dhrystone] 

== Web Browser Performance ==
Rendering of sample page, that counts time needed for proper render it. We must create that sample page...

= Notes =
   * How about Bezier curves? 
   * How about add text test (print, output) for 2D part 
   * add object transformation for 3D test 
   * add dynamic texturing and dynamic lighting
